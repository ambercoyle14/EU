    <h1> Social Responsibility </h1>
    
    <h2> What is Social Responsibility </h2>
    <p> <font size="5"> Social responsibility is an ethical framework and suggests that an individual has an obligation to work and co-operate with other individuals and organizations for the benefit of society at a large. IT is a duty that evryone has to preform so as to maintain a balance between the economy and ecosystems. It is a concept that aims to ensure secure healthcare for the people living in rural areas and eliminates all barriers like distance, financial condition, etc. This responsibility can be passive, by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts, or active, by performing activites that directly advance social goals. </font> </p>
    <p font size="5" style="color:#FF0000";> Example: </p>  <p> <font size="5"> Volunteering in the community - partake in an event such as tidy towns as it is good for the community and beneficial towards the environment </font></p>

    <h2>Local social awareness. Environment, neighbours, litter, law and order.</h2>
<p> <font size="5"> Local social awareness has got to do with your behaviour and morals in your local area, it has to do with respecting your local environment and keeping it safe,clean and habitable. You need to respect your neighbours and their area too, just as you would your own home. Keeping your local area clean, safe and habitable means picking up litter, binning litter into the correct bins, not dropping litter and being aware and educated of the cycle of rubbish and how it is affecting our world and lives daily - with this you could think of ideas of being more eco-friendly by doing acts such as upcycling old items, not giving int o fast fashion, donating unwanted items to charities and recycling. </font> </p>
